# How to install

##

<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this plugin

  <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue add minio <instance-name>
    ```

  <br/>

* For example, In my case I wanted to install **minio plugin instance** with my instance
  name as **“minio”**, then I will follow this pattern to install minio plugin instance in
  my app:

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add minio minio
    ```
    
    Here my instance name is **minio**.

  <br/>

* Now, after installing the dependency it will give you an output on the terminal in which
  information is present in order to interacting with your **minio server**.

  Output will be something like this:
    
    <img src={StorageScreenshot}/>
    

  <br/>

* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** there
  is a new folder named **storage** is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the **minio plugin instance** should be something like this:
  
  **backend/storage**

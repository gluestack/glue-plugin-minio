# How to install

##

To install this plugin, open your local terminal and type the following command:

```sh
$ node glue add minio <instance-name>
```

For example, if you want to install a **Minio plugin instance** with the name **minio**, use the following pattern:

```sh
$ node glue add minio minio
```
_Here my instance name is **minio**._

If the plugin is installed successfully, you can see a new **storage** folder created inside the **backend** directory.

The overall directory path for the **Minio** plugin instance should be something like this:

```jsx
  ðŸ“‚ backend
  â”— ðŸ“‚ storage
    â”— ðŸ“‚ minio
```
